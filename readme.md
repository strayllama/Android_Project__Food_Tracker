## CLASS BRIEF

# Java/Android Project Definitions - Solo Project

## Food Tracker
Goal: Practice OO and UI design with what we learned in Java / Android weeks

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal.
#### My Specific MVPs:
-- Track Daily: Water consumption, calories, Number of 5aDay, and negative Activity calories.
-- Allow users to add either 

### Project Extension
The app should show the user a record of what they have eaten over a given period e.g. In March I drank lots of Irn-Bru.

## General Rules (Applies to ALL projects)

* ***DO NOT USE ANY FRAMEWORKS*** - this includes Java Swing and similar packages. If in any doubt ask an instructor.
* There will still be stand-up at 9am every morning (10am on Friday) - you are still expected to be in every day during the project.
* If you have an idea for a project outwith the specs defined above then please discuss this with the instructors before going ahead.
